It works for both physical and digital resources and it has proved to be very flexible and powerful. One of the most important aspects of FRBR is the fact that it is not associated with a particular metadata schema or implementation.

FRBR describes all documents from four different and correlated points of view: Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item; each of which is a FRBR Endeavour. These can be illustrated by considering of the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll as an example:

Work. A FRBR Work is a high-level abstract Platonic concept of the essence of a distinct intellectual or artistic creation, for example the ideas in Lewis Carroll's head concerning Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, independent of any representation of these ideas in a particular form. A Work is realised through one or more Expressions;

Expression. A FRBR Expression is the realisation of the intellectual or artistic content of a Work. Thus the original text of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its Italian translation Le Avventure di Alice nel Paese delle Meraviglie refer to different Expressions of the same Work. An Expression is embodied in one or more Manifestations;

Manifestation. A FRBR Manifestation of a work defines its particular physical or electronic embodiment, for example, the particular format in which Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is stored: as a printed object or in HTML, represent two quite different Manifestations. In publishing, different manifestations of a journal article will all bear the same Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which identifies the Expression of the work, not its various Manifestations. However, a paperback and a hardback version of a book will bear different International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs), since these identifiers are assigned at the Manifestation level. A Manifestation is exemplified by one or more Items;

Item. A FRBR Item is a particular physical or electronic copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that a person can own, for example the printed version of the book you have in your bookcase, or the Mobipocket format copy you have downloaded to read on your e-book device. All Items that are identical to one another â€“ for example books from the same printing, are exemplars of the same Manifestation.</cmd:description></cmd:Description><cmd:Assessement><cmd:Recommendation><cmd:Rating>appears</cmd:Rating><cmd:Publisher><cmd:name>Awesome Humanities</cmd:name></cmd:Publisher></cmd:Recommendation></cmd:Assessement><cmd:Version><cmd:version>1.0.1</cmd:version><cmd:validFrom>2018-03-29</cmd:validFrom><cmd:Location><cmd:uri>https://sparontologies.github.io/frbr/current/frbr.xml</cmd:uri><cmd:type>dump</cmd:type><cmd:recipe>rdf</cmd:recipe></cmd:Location></cmd:Version></cmd:Vocabulary></cmd:Components></cmd:CMD>
